Wanting to branch out and discover new music? This project creates a personalized playlist based on your taste. I promise you'll discover songs you've never heard of and will enjoy them! And best of all, it's easy.
Steps:
1) Download both files to your machine.
2) Ensure they're saved in the same folder/path. One file is the python code and the other is the song dataset.
3) Run the Smart_Jukebox python code. The top cell installs the necessary packages. The bottom cell is the algorithm itself that reads the "Spotifiy_Youtube_smaller" .csv file and starts the program.
4) Answer the questions and it will curate a playlist for you based on your preferences.
5) To create another playlist, simply run the bottom cell again. Hope you discover some new favorite songs!
